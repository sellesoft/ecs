### 0.2.2 (2025-07-14)
- Fix errors when a watched plugin is deleted on disk
- Update build target to ES2021
- Reload/refresh open setting tab for reloaded plugins (Fix [#27]([#1](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload/pull/27)), thanks [@mnaoumov](https://github.com/mnaoumov))
- Fix [#26](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload/issues/26) - 0.2.1 sometimes doesn't reload without explicit refresh when vault is freshly opened

### 0.2.1 (2025-03-09)

- Don't reload unless files are actually changed (fixes an issue where sync tools reading plugin files could trigger a reload)
- Add donation link, per request (Fix [#25](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload/issues/25))
- Don't track versions of files other than main.js and styles.css, as other files don't need to trigger reloads

- Add license (fix [#5](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload/issues/5))

- Add a manual reload command for use in sandboxes

### 0.1.9 (2022-03-16)
- Enable sourcemaps in Obsidian 0.14+

  In Obsidian 14 and above, sourcemaps are stripped from plugins
  at load time unless the "debug plugin startup" setting is on.
  Hot Reload now automatically switches that option on when
  reloading a plugin, so you get sourcemaps while developing,
  without needing to keep the debug setting on all the time
  (or sourcemaps in memory all the time).
