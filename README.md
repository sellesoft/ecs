This is a git mirror of ecs' p4 directory. This mirror is not currently intended
to be built as it is missing several things from external projects that are 
properly mapped under a p4 stream. This mirror is more for use as a way to view
the source online without setting up something like P4 Code Review or manually 
hosting the source.

ecs used to be developed under the [enosi git repo](https://github.com/sellesoft/enosi), but
that project has since been moved to p4.

There is an Obsidian vault in this repo.
