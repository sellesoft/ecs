The **build system** uses a set of [[build_rule|build rules]] to compile [[source_data|source data]] and source [[asset|assets]] into [[compiled_data|compiled data]] and compiled assets. Everything the build system knows about is a [[build_target|Target]].  

The [[editor]] is currently the only thing that uses a build system. Later on the [[game]] might as well for compiling mods and such.
