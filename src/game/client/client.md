The **client** manages client-side systems related to the highest level of running the game (currently a [[src/game/client/notes/game_sim|GameSim]]). This may be reorganized, though, as with the reorganization of being built either as editor or game, there is not much need for the separation between client and game sim. Client will likely become what game sim was meant to be.
