The **ui** system provides an api for displaying various [[ui_widget|ui widgets]]. 

The ui system provides an [[immediate_mode|immediate style]] drawing api and attempts to minimize the amount of persistent information kept between ui frames.

A central and important concept in the ui system is its [[ui_id|id system]], for which more information can be found in its note.

For information about what happens throughout a ui frame, see [[ui_frame|ui frame]].
